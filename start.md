So, i can use this as the documentation steps or rather the (written) journey that is going to be
DotNet Documentation Helper - Ash

Yeah, i will talk in a yt video format. Well, a few days ago i noticed myself in a big problem where i couldn't read a certain documentation for a challenge where i inicially needed to create an E2EE app and the challenge evolved into making a discord copy in a week. But that a subject for another video, and i was struggling with the lib and this make me realise that im a fraud-NO, at the best a good programmer that couldn't read basic documentation resulting in a mental breakdown with a nightmares and big doubts about myself and my existence. And then i played friday night funkin for chills, and mid-game i realised something- im a great programmer, i just struggle with reading and understanding documentation and i don't want to either use chatgpt for everything or stare at the screen test out everything with tutorials and enp up doing nothing cause i dont know how to do something out of the tutorial cause is shit that i never saw in my life and call it a day. No, i needed a buddy who would guid me through the documentation with a step-by-step to understand every part of the demonstration code explaning why X does Y and why S function does this part and you get the idea. I wanted an IA helper that could explain to me the documentation with examples and explanations based on what you're seeing at the moment. 

This is where my brain trancendend and shined. But this isn't some multi-milionarie idea until i validate it. Thanks to a youtube guy (here put the link of the video) i can now validate ideas and decide to myself if is worth doing it. (I may put here the file with the instrunctions(no i wont)).

Since this is a public repo. YOU can pretty much see everything that is added and this video script included, if you are one of the guys i talk to in discord you will be the first ones to see it. And maybe add some cool features too.

Now lets validate the idea:

Q&A for VinceDev:

What is the problem?
    - Normal Response: The problem is that my ahh can't understand the documentation that i need to build something.

    - Better Response: Some people may have a problem with reading and understanding documentation, especially beginners.

What is the main problem that i want to solve?
    - I want to understand the tools that im using to create my application. 

Who im building this for?
    - Someone like me, new to the .NET environment. Having a hard time understading the tools that is using and that don't want to be highly dependent on ChatGPT and tutorials and have a mental breakdown whenever there's a problem rellated to the new lib that you're using (it happens very often) *skill issue

Who are the people that have this problem in the most severe form?
    - ^The argument before this

Ok, i've now ansewered the questions that i needed. Now i just have to interview people and see how often and how this affect they're daily-basis.

Yesterday i interviewed some people and aparenlty, this problem is more common in certain circunstances like:

    -A project that is requires a lot of research and/or involving more than one library
    -A project that is needed due in a short amout of time (this phrase might be wrong)
    -A project where the library isn't organized, specific and mostly outdated

But that never stopped us programmers so it may be *skill issue.

Still, my idea stays pretty valid and interesting so i'll build it.

Before starting the work i need to address some things:

1ยบ My main aim is to webscrap dotnet documentation pages(at first) to test it out and see
how can I use this on a daily basis as a C# programmer.

2ยบ I may or may not be commiting a crime since web scrapping in general legal, but i don't know how Microsoft is going to react as soon this goes viral(i know it will)

3ยบ This is supposed to be an Visual Studio tool (for desktop), but if you want to contribute we can make this an extension for your favorite code editor

(I dont really know why i said this, i'll build already)
